# Adare Restaurant Website

This was a practice website made for a fictional restaurant in an effort to learn HTML and CSS. It was coded along a tutorial on YouTube from creator "Bring Your Own Laptop."

## Functionality:

- Click on navigation links
- Click to begin an e-mail to inquire about a Reservation with Subject line pre-filled
- View restaurant on Google Maps and have the ability to interact with the map itself

## What I Learned

This project was primarily a refresher for me since I have previously coded very basic applications before. However, I was able to learn how to embed widgets in my website, such as Google Maps, YouTube, and OpenTable. Most of these widgets are commented out in the code in order to save their syntax for later reference. I was also grateful to further my understanding of some CSS principles such as the difference between margins and padding.

## Future Plans

I will likely try to design and implement the remaining navigation pages in order to make it a fully functioning website. I will also use the knowledge I gained from this project to build my own personal website.
